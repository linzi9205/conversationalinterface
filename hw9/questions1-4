1. What is "culture"?
Culture is shared patterns of behaviors and interactions, cognitive constructs and understanding that are learned by socialization.

2. Why is it useful to express culture?
Being able to express culture can enhance the engagement with the audience. This engagement is most often defined as empathy with charaters' emotions and predicaments, through the suspension of awareness of the narrative's created or artificial nature. It provides immersive experience with higher believability.

And in addition, the characters from the same ethnic background as the interactor are perceived to be more socially attractive and trustworthy than those from different backgrouns.

3.How can an agent express culture?
It involves consideration of the ten key characteristics: identity, backstory, appearance, content of speech, manner of speaking, manner of gesturing, emotional dynamics, social interaction patterns, role and role dynamics.

4.Many of you have characters that are not human-like (a cat, a burger, etc.) Would you consider them expressing some culture? If yes, why and how would you do that. If no, then why not?
Yes. Culture can be abstract. It doesn't need to be in the human appearance. Culture can be conveyed through personalities - which I think can still be embedded in the characters that are not human-like. For example, in many PIXAR cartoons - whether it's Toy Story, Finding Nemo or Cars, the characters are not human but they have the personalities that are like human. So the audience can resonate with them and feel engaged. The way to do that is to personify the object - think of it as a person.
